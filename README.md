# First-Project-On-Django
Here one can analyze a text given by him/her. He/she can Remove all Punctuation, Capitalized all letters of the text or New lines can be removed and Extra Spaces also can be removed.

# Updated Version
On 28-06-2020 I have added 2 new sections in this project. Before the 'About Us' and 'Contact Us' sections were inactive. In recent version, I have added 2 sections
- 'About Me', where one can know about myself
- 'My CV', where I put my Sourcerer protfolio.

I also did some minor changes on Main page of the site and also changed the name to 'MYSITE | Demo Site'
